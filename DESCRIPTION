Description: The presence of outliers in a dataset can substantially bias the
    results of statistical analyses. To correct for outliers, micro edits are 
    manually performed on all records. A set of constraints and decision rules
    is typically used to aid the editing process. However, straightforward
    decision rules might overlook anomalies arising from disruption of linear
    relationships. Computationally efficient methods are provided to 
    identify historical, tail, and relational anomalies at the data-entry 
    level (Sartore et al., 2024; <doi:10.6339/24-JDS1136>). A score statistic
    is developed for each anomaly type, using a distribution-free approach
    motivated by the Bienaym√©-Chebyshev's inequality, and fuzzy logic is used
    to detect cellwise outliers resulting from different types of anomalies.
    Each data entry is individually scored and individual scores are combined
    into a final score to determine anomalous entries. In contrast to fuzzy
    logic, Bayesian bootstrap and a Bayesian test based on empirical 
    likelihoods are also provided as studied by Sartore et 
    al. (2024; <doi:10.3390/stats7040073>). These algorithms allow for a more 
    nuanced approach to outlier detection, as it can identify outliers at 
    data-entry level which are not obviously distinct from the rest of the 
    data.
